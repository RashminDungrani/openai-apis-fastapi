## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project involves integrating OpenAI APIs into FastAPI applications to facilitate calling them using the Swagger UI. FastAPI is a modern Python web framework for building APIs quickly and efficiently. By leveraging FastAPI's features and integrating OpenAI's APIs, developers can build applications with powerful AI capabilities such as language translation, sentiment analysis, text summarization, question-answering, and more. The project may involve designing and implementing RESTful API endpoints that interact with the OpenAI APIs, configuring authentication and security measures, and documenting the APIs for consumption using the Swagger UI.
